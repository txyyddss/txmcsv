  # Minecraft 1.18+ indexes and maps block types for chunk sections to improve compression,

  # If this option is enabled, we will rebuild the mapping by sorted blocks amount.
  # This may slightly help with the compression rate, especially since we are changing the blocks too.
  # It also reduces the probability of ghost chunks(full chunk with portals [with sound], eta.) .
  # This could easily double the process time, if you care about the extra about ~0.2ms, disable it.
